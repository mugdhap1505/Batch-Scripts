
# Batch-Scripts

Batch Script are stores in simple text file and are incorporated to automate command sequences which are repetitive in nature that get executed in sequence, one after the other. Scripting is a way by which one can alleviate this necessity by automating these command sequences in order to make oneâ€™s life at the shell easier and more productive.

Command line interpreter takes the file as an input and executes in the same order. A batch file is saved with the .bat file extension. It can be written using Notepad or any other text editor.
